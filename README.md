# Overview

This game is a simple matching game with a farm theme. To play, click on a pair of cards. If they match, they will stay flipped over, but if they don't, they will return to their starting face-down position. Continue flipping cards until they are all face-up. When this happens, you win!

I wrote this software to expand my knowledge of python and learn a new style of project. It was my first attempt at creating a game, so I started with the "test game" file. This was based off of a code-along-style page on Real Python that I made some improvements to. 
After that, I started to create the memory game on my own. I used ChatGPT to tutor me along the way without showing me code. Overall, I am pleased with this product as a first-attempt, and I am excited to grow my knowledge.

# Development Environment

I used VS Code to develop this game. I also used:
* Python 3
* arcade (installed with pip)

# Useful Websites

* [Real Python - Arcade Tutorial](https://realpython.com/arcade-python-game-framework/)
* [Python Arcade Documentation](https://api.arcade.academy/en/platformer_tutorial_revamp/_modules/arcade/window_commands.html)

# Future Work

* Add a screen to display when the game finishes that congratulates player for winning and allows them to play again or quit.
* Add background music and more detailed graphics (ie. removing the background from some icons).
* Adding save/load capabilities that keep track of high score.
